# Overview - Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This machine learning model's purpose is to create a tool for Alphabet Soup select applicants for funding with the highest chance of success. A dataset of previous organizations that have been funded by Alphabet soup was provided, which contained categorical and numerical data including industry sectors, use cases, income, funding request, and success or failure. This model will attempt to predict the success or failure of an organization based on this data. 

# Results 

- Bullet list
              - Nested bullet
                  - Sub-nested bullet etc
          - Bullet list item 2 

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

# Summary 

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
